Some thoughts/ideas:

- Very interesting to see the ripples in using the max total distance strategy - how does 
increasing the number of voters affect the expected number of steps? Obviously decreases b/c less variance, but how quickly? I suspect doubling the number of voters increases the number of steps  by a factor of rougly sqrt(2). Kinda want to study that more in depth.
    - Could be a cool plot to see as well.
- Using the max total distance strategy, how does the spacing between the rings change as we get farther and farther out? Also a good research question.
    - And again, could be a cool plot.
- (NEVER MIND - this was only happening b/c I had forgotten to adjust max_r at each step) Interestingly, we seem not to be able to go *arbitrarily* far away with the max total distance algorithm - try a target of 200, 200 to see this. But, perhaps with some random noise/jiggling introduced, we could still take advantage of the system's contours to do better?
- Could try a strategy which picks at random from best ten boundary points rather than just the best one - could plot the best ten to see the difference.
    - Perhaps graph them first to see if it would lead to meaningfully different picks.
- Could potentially have a future iteration where points are bounded and see how far out we can get.
